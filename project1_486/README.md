## ***Nicholas Giro - Project 1 - Mapping the Coronavirus***

**The deployed front-end of this repository is accessible at [https://ngiro1.github.io/**]

The purpose of this project was to map the locations of known coronavirus outbreaks across China. The project was based on the map made by Johns Hopkins [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1PJW08R4ZoKm_s6oQeyLqiBuYzL7DPczJt2nhQ4EPgQXlffFm3yzdfOs8#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Data], and the data was gathered from the same data sources listed on the website including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in addition to the ChinaMap web portal.

To perform the analysis, QGIS was used to map the analysis and locations of the confirmed cases. A CSV with data was compiled for analysis and was sectioned out by day; weekly data by chosen dates was selected and compiled into a heatmap with a callout to the most dense number of confirmed outbreaks in the provinces of China.The final product will also contain a GIF created to show the increase in location density of the outbreak over time. Finally, the maps were exported (from print layout) into Adobe Illustrator where they were edited and then brought into GIMP to create the GIF.
