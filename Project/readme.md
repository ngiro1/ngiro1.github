## ***Nicholas Giro - Project 1 - Mapping the Coronavirus***

**The deployed front-end of this repository is accessible at [https://ngiro1.github.io/**]

The purpose of this project is to map the locations of known coronavirus outbreaks across the world. The project will be based on the map made by Johns Hopkins [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1PJW08R4ZoKm_s6oQeyLqiBuYzL7DPczJt2nhQ4EPgQXlffFm3yzdfOs8#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Data], and the data will be gathered from the same data sources listed on the website.

To perform the analysis, QGIS will be used to create the map and add in the known outbreak locations with the associated values. The final product will also contain a GIF created to show the increase in location density of the outbreak over time.
