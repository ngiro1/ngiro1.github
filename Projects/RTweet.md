[**Rtweet Lab Comparing Stay Home to Covid19 Tweets**]

In this lab, I utilized RStudio's Rtweet function to grab geotagged tweets (tweets that contain associated lat/long coordinates) containing the hashtags #StayHome and #Covid19 to compare the differences among the different states. After compiling the tweets, I imported the data as point coordinates into QGIS, grabbed population census data per state, and computed the statistical shares of the tweets per state and then compared the difference between the two to associate each state to whether the majority of the tweets were #Covid19 or #StayHome.
